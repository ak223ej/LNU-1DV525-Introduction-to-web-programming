The reason to seperate HTML and CSS is a separation of concerns.

HTML is the structure and base of the site.
CSS is the design.

This of it a human body.
The skeleton is the HTML and the skin, hair, eye color is the CSS.

The reason to seperate them is to make it easier to maintain and develop.
If the developer uses inline or embedded CSS in the HTML its hard for
a new developer to know where the styling is made!
